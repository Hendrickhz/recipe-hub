    "description": "This is absolutely one of my favourite winter dishes, the Middle-Eastern style spices combined with the dates give it a warmth and depth that is just SO good. After 8 hours the lamb shoulder is so tender it just melts in your mouth – but it also translates really well into a pressure cooker (see notes below). The addition of the dates gives it a bit of sweetness to combat the acidic wine and tomatoes, it ends up like a hug in a bowl. Freezes well, is naturally gluten and dairy free.",

    "notes": "Prep Note: if you can pre-soak your lentils for at least a few hours (or overnight), it will help them break down and is easier on your digestion. PRESSURE COOKING NOTES If you are pressure cooking this you will need to either score or cut your lamb into chunks rather than 1 large slab of meat, to ensure that it is tender and falling apart. It will ideally need at least 15 minutes of natural pressure release.",
